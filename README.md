# VBA-Challenge
This VBA challenge required me to loop through the source code to group the tickers (column A) together and then aggregate the total stock volume, the yearly change and the percent change for the stock. The grouping and aggregated values are displayed within a summary table (columns I through L). The percent change column adds conditional formatting based upon if the percent change was positive or negative.

Additionally, the greatest % increase (max) / decrease (min) and greatest (max) total stock volume are summarized in a 2nd summary table (columns N through P). 

The VBA script loops through each worksheet in the Multiple Stock Years workbook. The workbook is saved in this repository and is named multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm while the screenshots of each worksheet is also displayed below. 

The final VBA script is saved within this repository and is named multiple_year_stock_data.vba. The alphabetical_testing_psuedocode.bas and alphabetical_testing_solved.vba files show the code interations as the challenge was being worked through.
